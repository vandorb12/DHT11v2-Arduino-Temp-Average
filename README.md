# DHT11v2-Arduino-Temp-Average
Using the DHT11v2 humidity and temperature sensor, create a running average of the ambient temperature the sensor reads that is then printed to a LCD screen

The DHT11 library can be found on OSEPP's site for the DHT11. Import the library code into your Library. Be warry of what version of the sensor you get by looking for an "Update Notification" sticker on the packaging. The code for this project is currently optimized for the v2 sensor.
